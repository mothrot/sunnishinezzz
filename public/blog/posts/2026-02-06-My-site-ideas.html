      <p>So... I'm not the best at executing my ideas, I either take too long or I straight up don't know how to do it
        and I lowkey give up.<br>Knowing that, I wanna share some things I would like to add to my side, or just ideas i
        have!</p>

      <h3>Sitemap</h3>
      <p>I already have a pretty decent sitemap, it at least works (i think) but my original vision is supposed to look
        like the PvZ leaderboard screen on mobile!!!!!</p>
      <iframe width="360" height="210" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Tr20NvvDzeo" frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen></iframe> <img src="/blog/images/leaderboard.png" width="300">
      <p>It would start at the the space screen all the way down to the ground and the links (the sitemap itself) would
        be on the left side of the pile of zombies.
        <br>I really REALLY want that infinte scrolling effect but I CAN'T find the assets for this screen ANYWHERE.
      </p>

      <h3>Friends</h3>
      <p>I had this idea since the beggining... the moment i decided to make my site pvz themed i wanted my friends
        pages to look like <b>THE SUBURBAN ALMANAC</b></p>
      <img src="/blog/images/PlantsAlmanac.webp" width="360">
      <p>I have NO IDEA HOW TO MAKE IT...... i mean some javascript will definetly make it work but... that would be a
        lot...... <br>It would work just like the almanac in game but instead of plants it would obviously have some
        info about each friend or something like a picture, drawing or character that represents them, how we meet, what
        they like and a stupid quote of theirs :(</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Paranormal</h3>
      <p>I like paranomal stuff, ok? 👀 (I say as I hear something under my bed and I fr shat my pans /j)<br>
        It would be a pretty simple page with paranomal stories of mine or friends. I had the idea of having a little
        form on the side so people could submit their own spooky experiences and add them to the page.</p>
      <p>Other stuff I would add would be like a screamer when you scroll all the way down to the bottom or something
        lol</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Webgarden</h3>
      <p>I LOVE the idea of a webgarden and i would DEFINETLY make a ZenGarden layout for it... I mean LOOK AT THESE</p>
      <img src="/blog/images/webgarden.png" width="360">
      <p>Very zen garden shaped if you ask me.<br>I mean they are quite bigger than the plants in the zen garden but i
        just need to make the zen garden bigger and make it scroll down yk</p>

      <h3>Zombiquarium</h3>
      <p>Have yall seen <a href="https://melonking.net/free/software/flood">Leaky ring?</a> I wanna make a page for it
        and put zombies in it... but neocities not allowing external scripts is preventing me from doing this and I'm
        DYING...<br>Thinking of becoming a supporter again...</p>

      <h3>The Dawn Is Your Enemy</h3>
      <p>I had this idea a couple of days ago actually. It would either be a error or downtime page, people would get
        redirected to this page instead.</p>

      <h3>Videos</h3>
      <p>This is for my video page. I want something like a TV or screen in a dark room (not necesarily pitch black)
        maybe in a table and some vhs/dvd/whatever on the side you could click on and the videos would play on the
        screen :)<br>I actually saw sa pretty similar layout at <a href="https://datoxicwaltz.neocities.org/movies">THE
          CRYPT's film log</a></p>

      <p>For now, my video page is only this image:</p>

      <div style="height: 420px;">
        <h3>OCs</h3>
        <p>I have a good amount of ocs and decent lore and I want that in my site, I'm just too lazy to do it. I can't
          decide between giving them wiki style pages or something like their own little rooms. But doing this means I
          also have to write down their lore and universe, relationships, blah blah blah some bullshit (；￣Д￣)</p>
        <img src="/blog/images/littleshits.png" width="400" style="float: left;">
        <i>here are the things :3... fun facts:
          <br>- They are all self inserts redesigned!
          <br>- Connor, Nelly and Ann are sibblings (Ann is adopted)
          <br>- Huko is dating Ann, but she was originally dating Nelly
          <br>- Athen is married to Connor :3
          <br>- From oldest to youngest: Huko, Connor and Nelly, Athen, Ann.
        </i>
      </div>
      <p>I also got some fandom ocs, I'll probably make a little section for them too.</p>

      <h3>Recipes</h3>
      <p>I would love to share some of these, pecially traditional food from my country!<br>I'm starting to miss
        those...</p>
      <p>The problem is that I don't have the time to cook anymore, of course I can just give instructions but I'm
        better at demostrating things by myself rather than copy and pasting stuff from other places. <br>I would also
        like to demostrate how these dishes would really look in your plate.</p>

      <h3>"For you" stuff</h3>
      <p>Things like adoptables, quizzes, cliques, a fanlisting themed around PvZ!<br>I was aslo thinking of making a
        couple more of webrings (fnaf and latino)</p>
      <p>The sunflower sprite on the main page was actually meant to be an adoptable 0_0</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Manifesto</h3>
      <p>It would probably go in an <i>"about the site"</i> page or something. I still have no idea how I would word it
        all though.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>That's all for now! :3</p>
