      <h3>Tutorial on how to export your drawings, brushes and color palettes on IbisPaint X.</h3>
      <i>Since free ibis paint doesn't have enough space for your drawings!</i>
      <h4>Disclaimer:  I recomend using Google drive or Discord, sice <i>some mobile devices</i> may not recognize the IbisPaint as the app to open these files if you download them.</h4>
      <h3>Export drawing:</h3>
      <p>This is done one by one. Also, make sure to name your drawings to differenciate them from the rest!</p>
      <p>Go to the drawing you would want to export and press this little icon: <img src="/blog/images/ibis_share_icon.png" alt="blue share button" width="20px"><br>(on pc: <img src="/blog/images/ibis_share_icon_pc.png" alt="blue share button in pc" width="20px">, it appears on the top instead)<br>A file select menu will appear, press <b>IbisPaint Artwork (IPV):</b></p>
      <img src="/blog/images/select_file.png" alt="file type select menu" width="220px"> 
      <p>Then select where do you want to export the IPV file:<br>
      <i>Again, I recommend using Google drive or Discord, at least as a test just in case your mobile device doesn't recognize the files.</i></p>
      <img src="/blog/images/draw_export_m.png" width="220px" alt="Drawing export">
      <p>If you are on PC and with no clear options where to export you may have the option to copy the file, then you can paste it on your desktop or a folder:</p>
      <img src="/blog/images/export_pc_copy.png" alt="pc export, copy file option" width="220px">
    <h3>Export brushes, color palettes and configuartion:</h3>
    <p>Select the white gear icon on the corner of the menu screen <img src="https://sunnishinez.neocities.org/blog/images/gear_ibis.png" alt="white gear" width="20px"> and scrolldown to the bottom, here you will select <b>Backup Settings</b></p>
    <img src="/blog/images/export2.jpg" alt="settings menu, Other, Backup settings" width="220px">
    <p>Same as the IPV files, select where do you want to export it, it will save as a <b>ipcfg</b> file (which i suppose it means <i>ibis paint configuration).</i><br><i>It looks the same as the IPV export</i></p>
    <img src="/blog/images/config_export_m.png" width="220px" alt="Configuration export">
    <hr>
    <p>You now can delete the drawings from the IbisPaint app and save cloud space, or import your drawings and config to another to another device! Just make you you have access to wherever you exported these!</p>
     <hr>
    <h3>How do I get my drawings and config back?</h3>
   
    <h4>Drawings:</h4>
    <p><b>If you are on phone</b>Go to whatever app you used to export them and tap on it, the drawing will appear on the Ibis app. If this doesn't work or isn't an option try downloading them instead, then go to you files app and tap on the file, if you're lucky, your phone will recognize the IbisPaint app as the one that can run these files.<br>This is done one by one, if downloading the IPV files is an option for your phone, feel free to do that instead.<br><b>If you are on PC</b> downloading or clicking the IPV file on your pc will work just fine!</p>
    <h4>Configuration, brushes and palettes:</h4>
    <p>Same as the drawings, tap/click on the file wherever you put the file in, but once it opens these options will appear:</p>
    <img src="/blog/images/brushexport.png" width="220px" alt="Import settings">
    <p>Select <b>Custom brushes, original brushes, special pens, color palettes and other settings</b>, the not selected ones on the screenshot are optional, but I do recommend select "Clear existing color palettes"</p>
    <br>
    <p>I've been using this for years and I haven't come across to many problems. It may be tedious but it's an option :)<br>
    I'm not aware of any other problems you may come across using this method, so please test it before deleting anything! </p>
