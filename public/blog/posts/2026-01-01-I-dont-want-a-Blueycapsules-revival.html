      <p><i>Massive rant about the gone for good Blueycapsules comic and its fandom</i></p>
      <br>
      <p>SO... I've seen people talking about the blueycapsules comic around November or something which it's not really
        a problem if it wasn't for people straight up forgetting why it was cancelled in the first place
        <br> For context, blueycapsules was a fnaf collaborative fan comic canceled on 2023 because the main creator
        turned
        out to be a terrible person who would do weird stuff behind scenes, put CONCERNING details in the comic and its
        writing ||(racism, antisemitism, etc)|| and also EXPLOIT the rest of artist to either draw or cover up their ass
        from problematic situations. They (the main creator) would literally send the black artist of the group to
        defend them when someone called them RACIST. There was another racist too but I doubt anyone remembers them.

        I mean it's not bad to still enjoying the comic, I myself heavily kin/relate to one of the characters and I like
        to go back and chat with my friends about the comic and the fandom back then, it's kinda nostalgic… tho it's
        hard to read when you know what was behind it. But I swear if I see someone saying "bring back the fandom/comic"
        It's gonna give me brain failure 'cause there's no way they trynna revive something that it's gone for GOOD,
        artist don't wanna be reminded of it, they don't wanna be associated with it and sure they DON'T want it BACK.
        And I'm gonna keep that mentality until EVERY single victim says they don't mind anymore (which I doubt).

        Anyways i miss my kids, w*lliam aft*n is an ungrateful piece of shit who needs to get springlocked, and Philip
        and Fritz are the goats… BYE
